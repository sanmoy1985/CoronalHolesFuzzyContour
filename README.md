# CoronalHolesFuzzyContour
MATLAB code for detection of solar coronal holes in SDO/AIA image using fuzzy energy-based dual contour method.

## Detection of Coronal Holes Contour

For detection of coronal holes one need to download SDO/AIA 193 A jpeg images in 1024 resolution. Then follow one of the following instructions: 

Run demo_CoronalHolesFuzzyContour.m in order to execute coronal holes detection using fuzzy energy-based dual contour method.
